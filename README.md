It's an Android app.

## Development
Lotta environment secrets.
TODO: document them.

Install the Git pre-commit hook.
It will save you a lot of pain in the future.

## So you want to give me a job...

Companies love to give coding assignments to people when they are interviewing for jobs and I've done my fair share.
Here are a few projects of mine that I think do a good job of showing off my technical skills as an Android developer:

- [Photo Gallery](https://github.com/bryansills/Photo-Gallery): A Flickr client. Based on a project in the 5th edition of Big Nerd Ranch's Android guide (which I wrote), this Jetpack Compose implementation shows off infinite paging and clean unit tests.
- [Loud Ping](https://github.com/bryansills/LoudPing/) (this project): An unwieldy side project of mine trying to help me have a better relationship with the music I listen to. The UI side of things may be a bit basic, but I'm doing a lot of neat things in the Gradle world and one of my more thoroughly architected apps.
- [AllTrails](https://github.com/bryansills/AllTrails): An app to search for nearby restaurants to have lunch. The best app for showing off my UI skills.
- [Coda Pizza Multiplatform](https://github.com/bryansills/CodaPizzaMultiplatform): A multiplatform pizza customizing app. Based on a project in the 5th edition of Big Nerd Ranch's Android guide (which I wrote), I wrote and presented this Kotlin multiplatform app as a codelab at KotlinConf 2023 in Amsterdam.
